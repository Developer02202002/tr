# Tanki Reloaded[TR]
This project aims to make a sort of open-source Tanki Online type game. Players can run their own servers with custom statistics for every turret and hull, or they can play on the main TR page once the project \*_eventually_\*<sup><sub>(That's right, NotoriousKiller, *eventually*)</sub></sup> gets going.

Tanki Reloaded will be hosted at [tankireloaded.github.io](http://tankireloaded.github.io/)

##[TND], do note that everything under /bin is auto-generated, so there's no need to mess with anything in there until it gets transported to the website. The files are probably outdated anyways.
